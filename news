# History of user-visible changes

# Next

* The minimum required version of Emacs is now 26.1.
* `TAB` binding changed to `company-complete-common-or-cycle`, and `backtab`
  binding to `company-cycle-backward`
  (#[1499](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/1499)).
* Completion is restarted if it enters a new "field" at the end, as indicated by
  the `adjust-boundaries` backend action
  (#[1497](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/1497)). This
  benefits file name (and directory) completion.  The user option
  `company-files-chop-trailing-slash` has been removed, and the
  `post-completion` handler in `company-files` has been removed as well.
* Handle the case when the current c-a-p-f function changes mid-session
  (#[1494](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/1494)).

# 2024-09-23 (1.0.2)

* More reliable cache expiration (at the beginning of completion).

# 2024-09-21 (1.0.1)

* Fix for failover from a backend group to the next backend.

# 2024-09-21 (1.0.0)

* `company-complete-common` now performs generalized [expand common
  part](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/1488) completion when
  the backend supports that. In particular, for `completion-at-point-functions`
  it queries `completion-try-completion`. `company-dabbrev-code` and
  `company-etags` also do that when `completion-styles` support is enabled.
* `company-dabbrev-other-buffers` and `company-dabbrev-code-other-buffers` can
  now take a function as its value (#[1485](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/1485))
* Completion works in the middle of a symbol
  (#[1474](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/1474)).
* New user option `company-inhibit-inside-symbols`. Set it to `t` to switch
  closer to the previous behavior.
* Improved behavior when user types new character while completion is being
  computed: better performance, less blinking (in the rare cases when it still
  happened). This affects native async backends and is opt-in with
  `company-capf`.
* For that, `company-capf` supports interrupting computation on new user
  input. Completion functions that want to take advantage of this behavior
  should include `:company-use-while-no-input t` in the returned properties.
* `company-elisp` has been removed.  It's not needed since Emacs 24.4, with all
  of its features having been incorporated into the built-in Elisp completion.
* `company-files` shows shorter completions.  Previously, the popup spanned
  the whole absolute file name being completed, and now it starts after the
  nearest directory separator
  (#[1040](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/1040)).
* New user option `company-capf-disabled-functions`
  (#[1437](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/1437)).
* Better support for `yas-key-syntaxes`
  (#[1268](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/1268)).
* New user option `company-tooltip-scrollbar-width` with default 0.4.
* The tooltip uses a more complex rendering approach, supporting double
  width/CJK characters, as well as buffer text of different sizes
  ([#1394](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/1394)).
  `variable-pitch-mode` is also working better, although when using it it's
  recommended to customize the `company-tooltip` face to be monospaced.
* New user option `company-dabbrev-code-completion-styles`.  Use it to enable
  fuzzy matching in `company-dabbrev-code`
  ([#1215](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/1215)).  An example
  configuration one can try:

```el
(setq company-dabbrev-code-ignore-case t
      company-dabbrev-code-completion-styles '(basic flex))
```

* New user option `company-etags-completion-styles`, to be used the same way.

* The backend command `keep-prefix` is being phased out.  The built-in backends
  implement it internally now, which resolved a number of sharp edges (mostly)
  around "grouped" backends.  To make that easier, several helpers were added,
  such as `company-cache-fetch` and `company-substitute-prefix`
